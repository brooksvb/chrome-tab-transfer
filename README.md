# Chrome_Tab_Transfer

Created at SpartaHack 2016.

Tab Transfer is useful if you want to transfer multiple tabs between browsers or devices. TT will get current tabs and send a reqeust
to paste.ee to create a pastebin containing all URLs you currently have open. Input the link that opens on any other platform and you can
copy and paste the desired URLs into your browser.

We tried to find alternative pastebin options that would allow for clickable links, but none could be found that also had an API.
